# Web Scraper for viewcounters.neocities.org

This Python script scrapes data from the ViewCounters.neocities.org website and saves it as a JSON file.
## Requirements
Python 3

The requests, beautifulsoup4, and json libraries

## Setup
Install Python 3 if it is not already installed on your system.

Install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install requests beautifulsoup4 json
```

Usage

To run the script, open a terminal window and navigate to the directory containing the script. Then run the following command:

```bash
python scraper.py
```

The script will scrape the data from the ViewCounters website, print the data as a JSON string, and save it to a file called data.json.
Notes

The data is scraped from the HTML table on the ViewCounters webpage. If the structure of this table changes, the script may need to be updated to correctly extract the data.
The script only extracts data for rows that have 6 cells. If the table includes rows with a different number of cells, they will be ignored.
